# everything-counts-assignment2-25000148737

This notebook provides a statistical analysis of a video game sales dataset (`vgsales.csv`), combining:

- **Data cleaning and preparation**
- **Descriptive statistics** (numeric and categorical)
- **Visual exploration** of sales distributions and genre/region patterns
- **Inferential analysis**:
  - Welch's *t*-test comparing mean global sales for two genres
  - Multiple linear regression of log-transformed global sales
- **Market interpretation** in the context of:
  - AAA vs indie and “long tail” economics
  - Addictive / high-intensity genres vs cosy / pixel / retro genres
  - Regional dynamics (e.g. North America vs global)
  - Implications for publishers, indie developers, and consultants

This is created for the Everything Counts Module on Statistics at The London Interdisciplianry School Master's, 2025 for student 25000148737. 

AI Declaration: AI has been used for part of the code generated only for the section labelled '6. Regression: modelling log(Global_Sales)', with the rest being salvaged from previous projects, self-taught or learnt with lecture  materials for this assignment. All other code and markdown notes like conclusions are my own work.
